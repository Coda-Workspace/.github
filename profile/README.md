## 🎯 What You Get
📄 **Dynamic Documents**: Create living documents that combine text, interactive tables, and embedded applications in a single, seamless canvas.

## About Coda
Coda redefines the concept of a document by merging the flexibility of a word processor with the power of a spreadsheet and the functionality of an application builder. It starts as a blank canvas where teams can bring their ideas, processes, and data to life. Unlike static files, Coda docs are interactive hubs where information is connected and actionable. You can pull in live data, create automations that trigger actions across other tools, and design custom interfaces—all within a familiar document-like environment. This makes it an incredibly versatile platform for project management, note-taking, planning, and internal tool creation.

The platform is built for the modern, interconnected team. Whether you're running sprints with a dynamic product roadmap, building a team wiki that actually gets used, or creating a client portal that updates itself, Coda provides the foundational blocks. Its formula language and pack ecosystem connect to services like Google Calendar, Slack, and Jira, breaking down silos between your tools. By centralizing work into adaptable, powerful docs, Coda helps teams move faster, reduce context switching, and align around a single source of truth for their projects and processes.
